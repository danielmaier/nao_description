# nao_description


This is a fork of the nao_description package that supports parameterized joint_offsets, camera placement, and marker locations. 
It is particularly useful in combination with the kinematic_calibration package at https://github.com/danielmaier/nao_calibration.
However, for legal reasons, it contains no meshes of the robot, needed e.g. for collision checking. 

Note: This package should be merged with the current nao_description from https://github.com/ros-naoqi/nao_robot!

Description of the Nao robot model that can be used with robot_state_publisher to display the robot's state of joint angles.
